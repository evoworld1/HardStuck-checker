            This website was made for players who doubt their skill on
            Summoner's Rift and want to know if it's time to let it go. If
            you're one of them, you're in the right place!
          </li>
          <li>
            You are not to be annoyed/angry/furious with the outcome of your
            profile evaluation.
          </li>
          <li>
            The results of the evaluation are final and 100% accurate, based
            purely on your statistics - we do not accept cry-babies here, if you
            are one of them - we kindly inform you that we will not provide you
            with a contact information in case of any complains.
